For example, with this tag, we can add a get param called "redirectUri" and tamper with the href value:
<a href="https://www.bugbountyhunter.com/" id="redirectUri" name="redirectUri">here</a>

%E3%80%82 = .

Final URL =
https://www.bugbountytraining.com/challenges/challenge-7.php?redirectUri=https://www%E3%80%82google%E3%80%82com#bugbountyhunter.com/

It will redirect to google.com

This happens because the website tried to add some filter and also a regex on *.bugbountyhunter.com
